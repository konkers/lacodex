"The first age of the sun was destroyed by flood,

The second age of the sun was destroyed by the god of wind,
The third age of the sun was destroyed by the god of fire,
The fourth age of the sun was destroyed by blood and fire
falling from the sky."

The same thing was written in Mayan prophecy.

Could there be a connection?
